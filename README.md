This is our final project for our Numpy course! With it, we'll explore multiple problems related to [Sudoku Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku).

The project is a combination of notebooks that will guide you step by step through the process of, understanding sudokus, their representation using Numpy and finally how to solve them using a backtracking algorithm!. 

The completed code is the sudoku.py file
